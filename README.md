# Hello World

In your hello_world_spec.rb simply add a line to puts "Hello World!"

*Note* When you run your test suite, you will not see the output, you will only see RSpec output. To test your actual output, go into IRB

```
puts "Hello World!"
```

And you'll get a better sense of how that works.
